Steve Lomax Web Developer Portfolio 

This website was designed to be a hub for all my current and future projects as an up and coming web developer. Potential employers will be able to access this page to get a overall idea of my skillset and preview my work.

I used HTML and CSS for the webpage. I used flexbox for the layout, different styles applied by ids and classes. 

My portfolio will be very useful as a place to display my work as a web developer.
